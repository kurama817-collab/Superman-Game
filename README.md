# Superman-Style Game — Protocol Ψ

This repository is an **open-source experimental game framework** exploring how to build an
invulnerable-hero game (Superman-style) **without health bars**.

Instead of weakening the hero, this project shifts vulnerability to the **world itself** using
systemic consequence, ethical constraint, and persistent simulation — collectively called **Protocol Ψ**.

## Core Ideas
- No player health bar — the hero is invulnerable
- The world has a health bar (persistent damage and recovery)
- Player choices create irreversible consequences
- Power does not increase; **control** does

## Project Status
- Design architecture: Complete and documented
- Engine: (Unity or Unreal — TBD / in progress)
- Goal: Build a playable open demo with community contributions

## Telemetry Contract
Canonical telemetry event names (v1.0) are defined in
`telemetry/telemetry_events_v1.json`. This file is the single source of truth
for all emitters and analyzers.

## What This Is (and Is Not)
**This is:**
- A systems-first, open-source framework
- A learning and experimentation project
- A place for designers and engineers to collaborate

**This is NOT:**
- An official DC or Warner Bros product
- A licensed Superman game
- A promise of a finished commercial release

## How to Contribute
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.
