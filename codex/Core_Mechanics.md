# Core Mechanics

## Flight
- **Traversal model:** 3D free-flight with analog acceleration, braking, and banking controls.
- **Altitude rules:** Soft ceiling with atmospheric resistance and camera dampening above a threshold.
- **Momentum:** Speed carries between inputs; quick turns widen based on current velocity.
- **Collision response:** Glancing impacts cause deflection; direct impacts trigger contextual rescue or damage checks.
- **Navigation aids:** Optional flight corridor cues for mission beats and a "return to objective" impulse.

## Super Strength
- **Interaction states:** Lift, carry, throw, and brace.
- **Object classes:** Lightweight (one-hand), heavy (two-hand), and anchored (requires bracing).
- **Environmental impact:** Throw trajectories and landing force apply collateral damage logic.
- **Rescue actions:** Stabilize collapsing structures and clear debris with time-based strength checks.
- **Risk gating:** Strength actions scale city impact and reputation based on nearby civilians.

## Heat Vision
- **Precision targeting:** Lock-on for small targets; manual aim for area sweeps.
- **Energy cadence:** Short bursts to avoid overheat, with cooldown windows.
- **Damage profile:** Narrow beam pierces; wide beam sears surfaces and risks collateral ignition.
- **Utility use:** Cut supports, weld infrastructure, or cauterize hazards.
- **Feedback loop:** Visual cone and heat haze show the current risk and intensity.
